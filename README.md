## Description
When I created this site, I was trying to make an interactive map with relevant statistics regarding the suicide rates in the United States. While researching and gathering data, I found myself getting mildly upset about the way data was presented regarding suicide. It all just felt very cold. So instead of delivering the same information that you can find in a google search, I tried to change the narrative to humanization. These stats are far more than numbers, they are people. And that's the point I wanted to make with Humanize It.
